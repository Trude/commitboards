# Commitboards

> A place to show off how nerd you are

## small todos

- need text/plain header on boards#install response
- add automatic updating (check if response sais update. If so, run the install command with curl)
- get github url/add github link to commit
- obey $http_proxy / $https_proxy
- add board key/url to post-commit start/end comments to be able to add more commit board urls to one project?

### done

- force https on heroku
- add commit sha to commit
- resize images with imagemagic/imagesnap (imagemagick for now)
- add committer and project name to commit
- parse timestamp of commit and save as committed_at
- upload commit time as well
- try to upload previous unsuccessful uploads
- delete/clean successful uploads
- in background-capture: Show the actual board url, not the commits
